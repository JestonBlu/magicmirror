Setup for your host raspberry pi for running MagicMirror using Docker.

Requirements:
• running raspberry ri version 2 or 3 with running raspian jessie
• LAN or WLAN access
• logged in as user pi (otherwise you have to substitute "pi" with your user in the following lines)

Setup for MagicMirror
• create local directory ~/magic_mirror/config with your config.js file
• create local directory ~/magic_mirror/modules with your 3rd party modules

Setup Docker
• get Docker: 			curl -sSL get.docker.com | sh
• set Docker to auto-start:	sudo systemctl enable docker
• start the Docker daemon:	sudo systemctl start docker  (or reboot your pi)
• add user pi to docker group:	sudo usermod -aG docker pi

Setup docker-compose:
• execute 			sudo apt-get purge python-pip
• execute 			curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python
• execute 			sudo pip install docker-compose
 
Setup for graphical desktop:
• install unclutter		sudo apt-get install -y unclutter
• edit (here with nano)		nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
  and insert the following lines for disabling screensaver and mouse cursor:

  @xset s noblank
  @xset s off
  @xset -dpms
  @unclutter -idle 0.1 -pi

  uncomment the existing lines, otherwise you will see the desktop before MagicMirror has started
• edit (here with nano)		~/.bashrc
  and insert the following lines (otherwise docker has no access on the pi display):

  export DISPLAY=:0.0
  xhost +local:root	

• execute 			sudo raspi-config
  goto "3 boot options" and choose "B2 Wait for Network at Boot"

  If not set some modules will remaining in "load"-state because MagicMirror starts to early.

Setup docker-MagicMirror:
• execute			git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/bastilimbach/docker-MagicMirror.git ~/docker-MagicMirror

Get the docker image:
• execute:  			docker pull bastilimbach/docker-magicmirror

Starting MagicMirror:
• goto 				cd ~/docker-MagicMirror/up-raspberry
  and execute			docker-compose up -d

  in case you want to stop it	docker-compose down
